**Issues/Problems/Errors**

Initial issues creating the database, having to nest arrays in the table.

**Additional Features**

Would like to add the ability to track all of the users scores and display them in a chart with various metrics for tracking handicap. Also aiming to add user sessions where each user has the ability to track and manage their own scores while not being able to access other users scorecard data.
